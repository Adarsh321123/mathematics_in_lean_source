Algebra
=======

Ideas:

* Constructing specific groups, like the dihedral group, Sn, residue groups, the binary product of two groups

* Lagrange's theorem, and the Euler-Fermat theorem as a corollary.

* The first isomorphism theorem

* Cauchy's theorem (if :math:`p` divides :math:`o(G)`, then :math:`G` has an element of order :math:`p`).
