Algebra
=======

Ideas:

* Background on how to declare a structure, make it extend another structure and inherit its definitions and theorems, use notation like ``*`` and ``<``. Maybe do this with a roll-our-own group and comm_group, and after that use the ones in mathlib.

* Remember that the logic chapter will have examples of calculating in a group. But maybe we can add more examples and exercises here, especially if they have interesting mathematical content, as in a homework assignment in an introductory algebra class.

* Constructing specific groups, like the dihedral group, Sn, residue groups, the binary product of two groups. Show, for example, that there are exactly two groups of order four, up to isomorphism.

* Lagrange's theorem, and the Euler-Fermat theorem as a corollary.

* The first isomorphism theorem

* Cauchy's theorem (if :math:`p` divides :math:`o(G)`, then :math:`G` has an element of order :math:`p`).
