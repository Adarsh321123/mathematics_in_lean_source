Induction
=========

Defining arithmetic
-------------------

We'll run through addition, multiplication, and exponentiation, Ã  la the natural numbers game.


Fibonacci numbers
-----------------

Then we'll do fibonacci numbers or something like that. By now, students should be able to prove interesting identities.


The AM-QM Inequality
--------------------

We'll try taking the students through a proof of this,
or something else that puts everything together:
induction, inequalities, calculations,
and theorems from the library.
